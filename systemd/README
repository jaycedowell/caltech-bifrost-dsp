MaaS is configured to install all .service files into /etc/systemd/system when
provisioning GPU hosts for LWA-352. Likewise, all .sh scripts will be installed
into /usr/local/bin. The service files can then reference the .sh files in
/usr/local/bin. See: nvidia_tweaks* as an example. This is mainly used for
oneshots which need to set the system on each boot as compared to a running
service.

Simply add new .service files and .sh files to this dir and commit and the next
provisioning will pick them up.
